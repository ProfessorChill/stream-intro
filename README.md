# Stream Intro

I do livestreaming sometimes, I needed an introduction and I'm not particularily
an artist so I decided to make a simple application in JS to show the stream a
waveform and any background I wanted to put on it.

## How to run

```
$ npm i
// Development mode
$ npm run start
// Build index.html
$ npm run build
```

## How to edit background

Currently the background image is hard coded in the `index.html` css code. This
is because I do not stream much so manually changing it is not particularily
difficult to do pre-stream.
